## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Superstore’s business performance using an interactive **Google Looker Studio dashboard**.  
The analysis focuses on **sales, profitability, discount impact, shipping performance, return behavior, and geographic trends** to support data-driven business decisions.

PDF exports of the dashboard and a detailed business analysis are included in this repository for offline review.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze sales and profit performance over time (2014–2017)
- Identify drivers of profit volatility despite sales growth
- Evaluate the impact of discounts on profitability
- Assess shipping performance and its relationship with return rates
- Compare performance across segments, products, regions, and cities

---

## 📈 Dashboard Structure
The dashboard consists of three main sections:
- **Sales Overview:** sales trends, segment contribution, and geographic distribution  
- **Profit Overview:** profit metrics, discount impact, and product-level profitability  
- **Shipping Performance:** shipping modes, delivery time, profitability, and return rates  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Sales grow consistently, but profit remains highly volatile.
- Over **26% of orders generate negative profit**, largely driven by high discount levels.
- High sales volume does not always translate into high profitability.
- **Standard Class shipping** provides the most stable balance of volume, profit, and returns.
- **Same Day shipping** is the fastest option but has the highest return rate.
- Performance varies significantly across regions and cities, with **New York City** leading in both sales and profit.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Control excessive discounting to protect profit margins.
- Shift focus from revenue growth to profit-quality KPIs.
- Prioritize consistently high-margin products and sub-categories.
- Apply Same Day shipping selectively for high-value and high-margin orders.
- Optimize Standard Class shipping as the most balanced delivery option.
